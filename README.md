What is Dogja?

Dogja is program made in godot that give users better reading experience of offline copies of manhwa than just looking at page one by one with built in windows image viewer.
It tries to emulate the experience or reading manhwa that webtoon website/app and scanlation websites give, although currently not as good.


Backstory

I have enjoyed reading manhwa for years now however as the years pass by more and more media online gets lost or very hard to access as such nowadays I always try to get offline copies of software and media that i like whenever possible.
However for manhwa there isn't much of comunity that perserves the media and i belive one of the big reasons why is the lack of way to experience manhwa offline the same way it is experienced online. Beacuse of that and my desire to 
perserve the best manhwa ever created (The Greatest Estate Developer) now that it finished i decided to rooll up my sleeves and create Dogja.


What features does it currently have? and what features are being proposed for the future?

Currently Dogja allows you to read manhwa, although you can put anything in, however it will be presented the same way as manhwa, you can scroll by clicking and dragging or scroll with your mouse wheel, it also as support for icon for each series 
and other small customizable things.

Some of the features that I want to add to Dogja, but are currently absent, include:

  Proper Manga and Western Comics support

  Installer

  An easy in-software way to add new series and chapters

  Android support

  Support for more file extensions

  More user customization options

Note: Some or all of the features listed above may be implemented only partially or not at all. Other features not listed here may also be added in the future.
