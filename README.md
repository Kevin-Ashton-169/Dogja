What is Dogja?

Dogja is program made in godot that give users better reading experience of offline copies of manhwa than just looking at page one by one with built in windows image viewer.
It tries to emulate the experience or reading manhwa that webtoon website/app and scanlation websites give, although currently not as good.


Backstory

I have enjoyed reading manhwa for years now however as the years pass by more and more media online gets lost or very hard to access as such nowadays I always try to get offline copies of software and media that i like whenever possible.
However for manhwa there isn't much of comunity that perserves the media and i belive one of the big reasons why is the lack of way to experience manhwa offline the same way it is experienced online. Beacuse of that and my desire to 
perserve the best manhwa ever created (The Greatest Estate Developer) now that it finished i decided to rooll up my sleeves and create Dogja.
